# Anonymous controller

It is a Progressive Web Application controller, through which we can control the IoT robot over the internet from all around the world.
I have used MQTT protocol for the communication between the application and the robot, along with appwrite integration for the authentication for the users to access the controller, also have a real time database for tracking the user events performed on the controller and get saved on the database.

Developed using **Appwrite** deployed on Digital Ocean, React, Recoil, Service Workers, MQTT, Arduino, ESP, Mosquitto broker deployed on AWS.

You can heads over to [https://appwrite-hack-robo.netlify.app](https://appwrite-hack-robo.netlify.app) to control the robot from where you are sitting, just remind me to turn on the power supply.üòÅ
