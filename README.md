# Anonymous controller

It is a Progressive Web Application controller, through which we can control the IoT robot over the internet from all around the world.
I have used MQTT protocol for the communication between the application and the robot, along with appwrite integration for the authentication for the users to access the controller, also have a real time database for tracking the user events performed on the controller and get saved on the database.
